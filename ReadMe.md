# Summary

## Project Purpose:
To simulate in a safe lab environment how an exploit works and how it can generate alerts in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. At the end of the lab the student will see how a simple exploit works and 
how that can be seen using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint queries.

## About the lab
In this fictious scenario (See Scenario Creation) we assume that the user (an administrator) is sent an spear phising email from her IT department asking her to update her notepad, for security reasons.  The unsuspecting user downloads the file and runs the file.  It says 'updating notepad' and reloads the application.  It seems odd, but nothing seems to be happening otherwise, but she decides to check with the IT department anyway, only 
to find out that they don't have any idea whats she's talking about.  They escalate this issue to the IT Security Team.
