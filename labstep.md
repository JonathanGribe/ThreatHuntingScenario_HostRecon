“The notepad updater v.2”

## Basic Lab Information:

Prerequisite:  
Basic familiarity with using Azure portal  
\-Creating Virtual machines  
\-Creating Storage accounts

**Introduction:**

**Purpose:**

**MitreATTACK TTPs:**

This PowerShell script demonstrates a multi-stage adversarial behavior that aligns with several MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Here's a breakdown of the relevant Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):

🧠 Initial Access & Execution

-   T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell  
    The entire script is executed via PowerShell, which is commonly abused for code execution, automation, and evasion.

🔍 Discovery (Reconnaissance)

-   T1082 – System Information Discovery  
    Queries OS, architecture, domain membership, and system details.
-   T1033 – System Owner/User Discovery  
    Captures username and privilege context.
-   T1069 – Permission Groups DiscoveryUses whoami /groups to enumerate group memberships.
-   T1518.001 – Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery  
    Checks Windows Defender status and real-time protection.
-   T1012 – Query Registry  
    Reads registry keys for startup persistence opportunities.
-   T1057 – Process DiscoveryUses schtasks to enumerate scheduled tasks.
-   T1016 – System Network Configuration DiscoveryUses Test-NetConnection to check internet connectivity.

📤 Exfiltration

-   T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 ChannelUses Invoke-RestMethod to upload data to a remote Azure blob storage endpoint.
-   T1567.002 – Exfiltration to Cloud Storage  
    Specifically targets Azure Blob Storage for data exfiltration.

🛠️ Persistence & Privilege Escalation

-   T1136 – Create Account  
    Creates a new local user account (NetSync) for persistent access.
-   T1078 – Valid Accounts  
    The new account is added to the Administrators group, enabling privileged access.
-   T1112 – Modify Registry  
    Alters registry to hide the newly created account from the login screen.

🧪 Defense Evasion

-   T1036 – Masquerading  
    GUI mimics a legitimate “Notepad Update” to deceive users.
-   T1564.002 – Hide Artifacts: Hidden Users  
    Registry modification hides the account from the login interface.

### Notepad updater exploit – Powershell:

How it works:

This script is designed to be a “notepad updater”.  It tricks the user into thinking their notepad application needs updated for security reasons. For he purpose of this lab we assume that we have some form of initial access. When the .exe file is clicked it will load a ‘updating notepad’ alert and simultaneously open notepad.
It will gather all of the users host information and attempt to exfiltrate the data onto an Azure Blob storage account(Certain parts of the script to be edited are highlighted). Finally, a backdoor is created via an additional account that is secretly added as to not appear during the login process.

## Steps:

1.      Create Virtual Machine

2.      Create Azure  Blob Storage Account  
\-Create container (to receive host information from script)

3.      Add VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

4.      “Bad Actor” - Create exploit (Script and executable)

5.      Run executable

6.      “Analyst” – Run KQL queries to determine what happened

7.      Remediation – Device reimaged and alerts created

**1.	Create Virtual Machine:**
Created a virtual machine to be used to represent an administrators computer. Hostname: AdminWorkstation1.  IP: 20.81.225.156.

**2.	Create Blob Storage Account:**

**3.	Add VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**
   1.	Locate the link to copy/paste into cmd
A.	Go to MDE (https://security.microsoft.com)
B.	Left column: Settings  Endpoints  Device Management  Onboarding
C.	Download Onboarding package
If package not available contact your administrator

<img width="975" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9066dd19-e131-4ebc-a137-cfe3fef92a7e" />

2.	Once package downloaded:
A.	Right-click
B.	Run as administrator
C.	Copy/paste into cmd

3.	Once command ran:
Check Asset Management -- > Devices  Search hostname (as seen in the VM)

<img width="975" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb5b558-e265-4962-82b3-d4251415181b" />

OR run query in Advanced Hunting:
DeviceInfo
| where DeviceName contains "Admin" and OnboardingStatus == "Onboarded"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, PublicIP, OnboardingStatus

Substitute “Admin” with the beginning of your device name.

If do not have host name:
Log into VM  Type cmd in search box by windows icon  Pull up command prompt  type ‘hostname’ in the field.

**4.      Create and edit powershell script and .exe file**

Script provided above. Working in virtual machine.

Creating .ps1 file:

1.      In VM open up Powershell ISE

2.      Create ‘new script’ (top left) and copy/paste script

3.      Save .ps1 file on desktop

Editing the .ps1 file:

Background: This .ps1 file will need to be edited in order to have the host information gathered off of the vm to your blob storage account in Azure. To do this we will need to grab the Blob URL which will include the SAS token.

1.      Reopen the script for editing

2.      Gathering the SAS token (In blob storage account):

Creating .exe file (Using PS2EXE module):

1.      Open Powershell

2.      Install PS2exe:

A.     In powershell: Install-Module -Name ps2exe

B.     To convert:  ps2exe .\\MyScript.ps1 .\\MyScript.exe -noConsole -noOutput -noError

The first part .\\MyScript.ps1 is the name and  filepath were the script file is that we saved onto the desktop.  The .\\MyScript.exe is the name that you want the executable to be included with the filepath. The -noConsole -noOutput -noError is for hiding anykind of background processes that maybe going on while script is executing to avoid suspicion.

Once created you should get an icon showing the .exe file as such:

**5.	Run the .exe file**

**6.	Security Analyst – Research**

**1. Find any newly cread file within the past three days under the current user profile** 
KQL Query:

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "adminworkstatio" and  Timestamp > ago(3d)
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| where FolderPath startswith @"C:\Users\johnUser\appdata"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath
|  order by  Timestamp desc 
```
**Findings:**

**2.Searching for device processes:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1d)
| where DeviceName == "adminworkstatio"  and AccountName  == "johnuser"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine matches regex @"notepad|calc|cmd|powershell"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc  
```

**3.Searching for any outbound connections (for data exfiltration)

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1d) and DeviceName == "adminworkstatio"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| where ActionType == "ConnectionSuccess" and RemoteUrl has "azure"
| project Timestamp, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp desc  
```
<img width="975" height="131" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8357e3cf-ad0d-4f5c-8d0c-e85fb7689548" />


**4.	Querying Device Registry Events table to search for backdoors and other accounts**

1.	Auto-run
Query:
```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where DeviceName contains "adminworkstatio"
| where RegistryKey startswith @"HEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
| order by Timestamp asc 
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName 
```
2. Scheduled Tasks

3. Powershell obfuscation

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "adminworkstatio"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-EncodedCommand"
|project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessAccountName 
```

**7.	Remediation:
Since it was discovered that adminworkstation was the only infected computer a device reimage was performed.**
